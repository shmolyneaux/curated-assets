        <p>This is a website dedicated to providing a curated collection of free
        game assets. All assets are free to use in unlimited commercial and non-commercial game projects. The goal is to make high-quality free assets more easily available. Every asset is picked, tested, uploaded, and described by <a class="text-rose-600 hover:underline" href="https://github.com/shmolyneaux/">Stephen Molyneaux</a>. You can find all of these assets elsewhere online. Where possible, a link to the official source for the asset is included. Please try to support the creators wherever possible!</p>
        <p>The goal of this site is <em>not</em> to archive all free game assets. My goal is to make finding game assets a joyful and inspirational experience.</p>
